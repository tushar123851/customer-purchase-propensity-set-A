STEP 10: SHORT SUMMARY

1.TECHNIQUES USED:


- Missing value handling using median imputation and logical defaults
- Outlier detection and treatment using IQR and clipping
- Feature engineering (total_purchase_value, purchase_per_day, date-based features)
- Log and power transformations (log1p, Yeo-Johnson)
- Feature scaling using RobustScaler
- Binning and binary feature creation

2.BIGGEST ISSUES WITH RAW DATA:


- Extreme outliers in price and annual_income columns
- Highly skewed numerical distributions
- Mixed data types (IDs containing letters)
- Date columns not converted to datetime
- Zero values causing issues in log transformations

3.BEST IMPUTATION & SCALING:


- Median imputation worked best due to skewed distributions
- RobustScaler performed best because it is resistant to outliers
